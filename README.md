# Vim rails basic setup

## What's this?

A simple, ready-to-use basic Vim IDE setup for web development with pre-configured plugin management

## Set up

* Clone this repo in your ~/ folder
* Open any file with Vim, and use the `:PackUpdate` command

## What's included

* minpac plugin manager : just put the repo names of the plugins you want in `.minpac.vim`, and run `:PackUpdate`, and/or `:PackClean` to delete plugins that are not listed there.
* vimrc tuned to feel like a fresh install of VSCode

## Contributions

Any suggestions would be very welcome
